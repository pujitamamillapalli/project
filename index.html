    <h1><u>AIR POLUTION</u></h1>
    <big><h4>Definition</h4></big>
    <p>
      Air pollution is contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any
      chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies the natural
      characteristics of the atmosphere. Household combustion devices, motor
      vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires are common sources of air
      pollution.
    </p>
    <h3><big>Causes of Air Pollution</big></h3>
    <p>
      In addition, air pollution can be divided into Primary and Secondary types
      of pollutants. Whereas primary pollutants are caused by primary sources –
      i.e. the direct result of processes (such as industrial emissions or
      volcanic eruptions ) – secondary pollutants are the results of
      intermingling and reactions by primary pollutants (such as carbon
      emissions and water vapor, which creates smog).

      * Some important measures that can be adopted by individuals to contribute
      towards the prevention of air pollution have been listed below.
    </p>
    <p>
      * Usage of public transport and carpooling – by reducing the amount of
      fuel combusted for an individual’s transportation needs, he/she can lower
      the amount of pollutants being released into the atmosphere and cause less
      air pollution. Furthermore, these options are also economically efficient
      and can help save money as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      * Switching off the lights when they’re not in use – the majority of our
      electricity is produced from the combustion of fossil fuels, which are a
      huge contributor towards air pollution. Therefore, conserving electricity
      is an effective way of preventing air pollution.
    </p>
    <p>
      * Reusing and recycling products – By reusing products (that can be
      reused), the amount of energy that goes into manufacturing another one of
      those products is conserved. Furthermore, recycling of products is also
      more energy-efficient than the manufacture of new ones.

    />
    <p>
      * Avoiding the burning of garbage and smoking – burning of garbage is a
      huge contributor to air pollution. Another contributor to air pollution is
      cigarette smoking. Avoiding these activities and spreading awareness of
      their negative consequences can be of great help in the prevention of air
      pollution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Avoiding the use of firecrackers – firecrackers are generally used to
      celebrate certain occasions. However, they are known to cause severe air
      pollution and are, therefore, extremely harmful to the environment.
      Personally avoiding the use of firecrackers and spreading awareness about
      their negative consequences is a great way to help prevent air pollution.
